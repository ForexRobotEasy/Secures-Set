# Secure Set Expert Advisor

This Expert Advisor (EA) is designed to trade high volatility trends in the Forex market. It sets up pending orders based on the current market prices and adjusts trailing stops to protect profits. The EA also includes a flexible strategy implementation and necessary trading functions.

## How it Works

### Initialization
The EA sets optimization parameters for high volatility, such as optimization criterion, direction, and steps. It then handles the currency pair by setting the stop level for a specific currency pair.

### Trend Trading Strategy
The EA uses pending orders to implement a trend trading strategy. It calculates the buy and sell prices based on the current market prices and places buy and sell stop orders accordingly.

### Trailing Stop Orders
The EA sets basic trailing stop orders for existing trades. It calculates the trailing stop value based on the symbol's point value and modifies the orders accordingly.

### Trailing Stops for Real and Pending Orders
The EA updates trailing stops for both real and pending orders. It selects each order and checks its type. If the order is a buy or sell order, it modifies the order's trailing stop value based on the symbol's point value.

### Flexible Forex Strategies
The EA includes a strategy variable that can be set to different values. It uses a switch statement to implement different strategies based on the selected value. The code includes examples for strategy 1 and strategy 2, but more strategies can be added as needed.

### Trading Functions
The EA includes necessary trading functions that are not explicitly mentioned in the code. These functions can be added to perform specific trading operations.
